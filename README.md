# BukkitHook

A simple chat bridge for Discord and Minecraft.

In your `plugins` directory, there will a subdirectory named `BukkitHook`.
Inside, there will be a file named `config.yml`.
Open it using your favorite text editor (such as NotePad), and add the following:

```yaml
webhook_url: "WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"
```

You must put your Discord webhook's URL there.
